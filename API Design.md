API Design & Architecture Patterns

1. API Gateway Pattern

A single entry point for all clients. Handles routing, caching, auth, rate limiting, etc.

> Use with tools like YARP, Ocelot, or Azure API Management in .NET.


---

2. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)

Each client (web, mobile) has its own backend tailored to its needs.

> Keeps logic simple, reduces over-fetching/under-fetching.




---

3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate models for reading (queries) and writing (commands).

Improves performance/scalability.

Enables caching on the read side easily.


> Often used with MediatR in .NET.


---

4. Event-Driven / Event-Sourcing

Events (like “OrderPlaced”) are published to a bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

Other services subscribe/react.

Helps with scaling, audit, and data syncing (e.g., cache invalidation).



---

5. Rate Limiting / Throttling

Prevent abuse or overload by limiting:

requests per user/IP

Burst traffic


> Tools: AspNetCoreRateLimit, Redis counters, API gateway rate limits.


---

6. Circuit Breaker / Retry / Timeout Patterns

Improve resilience when calling downstream services:

Retry for transient errors

Timeout for long waits

Circuit breaker to stop flooding failing services


> Use Polly in .NET for implementing these.


---

7. Response Caching

Cache entire HTTP responses at API or reverse proxy layer.

Works well for GET endpoints with static or rarely-changing data.


> Use [ResponseCache] in ASP.NET Core or configure via a CDN/gateway.


---

8. Data Shaping and Partial Responses

Allow clients to specify the shape of the data (fields they want).

GET /products/1?fields=id,name,price

> Reduces payload size and supports frontend needs better.



📦 Bonus: Distributed Caching Patterns

In microservices:

Distributed Cache (Redis) to share cache across services.

Per-service cache + cache-coherency via pub/sub (invalidate on change).


✅ When to Use What?

Pattern	Use When...

Cache-aside	Default, flexible, works well for read-heavy APIs

Read-through	Want the app to be unaware of fallback logic

Write-through	Need consistency immediately after writes

BFF	Frontend teams need tailored APIs

CQRS	Read and write patterns diverge in complexity/performance

API Gateway	Microservices architecture, unified entry point

Circuit Breaker + Retry	APIs depend on unstable downstream services

Response caching	You return static data, and want fast responses
