## GitHub Copilot Example Prompts

## Example prompts you could use with GitHub Copilot to help generate xUnit tests for a method of a class:

1. **For General Unit Test Generation:**
   - _"Generate xUnit test methods to validate the functionality of the `CalculateTotal` method in the `OrderService` class."_  
   - _"Write xUnit test cases for the `IsValidUser` method in the `UserValidator` class."_  

2. **For Specific Scenarios:**
   - _"Create xUnit test cases for the `GetUserById` method in the `UserRepository` class, including scenarios where the user is found and not found."_  
   - _"Generate xUnit test methods for the `ProcessOrder` method in `OrderProcessor`, handling both successful and failed transactions."_  

3. **For Exception Handling:**
   - _"Write xUnit test cases for the `Divide` method in the `MathUtility` class, including checks for a divide-by-zero exception."_  
   - _"Create xUnit tests for `LoadFile` in `FileLoader`, verifying it throws `FileNotFoundException` if the file path is invalid."_  

4. **For Edge Cases:**
   - _"Generate xUnit tests for the `CalculateDiscount` method in the `DiscountService` class to handle edge cases like zero or negative values."_  
   - _"Write xUnit tests for `GenerateReport` in `ReportGenerator`, ensuring it handles an empty dataset."_  

5. **For Parameterized Tests:**
   - _"Generate a parameterized xUnit test for the `Add` method in the `MathHelper` class, testing multiple input-output pairs."_  
   - _"Create a theory-based xUnit test for the `GetGreeting` method in the `GreetingService` class, testing different times of the day."_  

6. **For Mocking Dependencies:**
   - _"Write xUnit test cases for the `SendEmail` method in `EmailService`, mocking the dependency on `SmtpClient`."_  
   - _"Generate xUnit tests for the `SaveCustomer` method in `CustomerService`, using a mocked `ICustomerRepository`."_
